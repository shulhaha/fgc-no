											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">As online gambling is getting more and more popular in the world, Australia has its own options to offer to the customers. Fair Go casino is a good choice, and in this article we will tell everything you may need to know about it.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">It was founded in 2017, and for all these years, this establishment managed to gain all the trust and consumers' choices. It is designed especially for Australian players. That is why they will not meet any problems connected with language, currency or region of gambling. In the pros, we can put Bitcoin paying, 24/7 customer service and great bonuses for every player: from the new to the experienced ones.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">The process of becoming a part of this club is not difficult, and you will learn all about it at the end of this article. From players' reviews it is clear that you will not regret joining this Fair Go casino.</span></p>
											<h2 id="question_1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Fair Go Casino Bonuses</span></h2>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Bonuses are an important step to check on while choosing any legit place for gambling. What is the purpose of them? The first and the main thing is that you are getting a chance to try any game you like and get used to it.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">As you can understand, they are giving you free money, spin, or just opportunities to earn even more. You do not need to pay for them, but sometimes it is important to complete requirements, so you can get more. They are not hard, but mandatory:</span></p>
											<ul>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">The first one to see is a welcome bonus. $1 000 will be divided between the first 5 deposits you are going to make. Therefore, you are getting all the money, and have a chance to spend it reasonably. The code for this operation is “welcome”. Only signs are allowed to take part.</span></li>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Deposit bonus 2023 is a chance to get your funds back from the deposit percentages. It will be given in the size of $200 for 100% and even 30 free spins.</span></li>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Free bonuses have their name for a reason, so customers are not forced to make any additional deposits. In this way, they will get up to 175$ on 100 %.</span></li>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Cashback bonuses are made to return some sums from your spending in the cash, so you can use them in other cases. Fair Go casino gives 30% on your deposits.</span></li>
											</ul>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">In addition to these ones, there are also unscheduled bonuses, which can be given only on some special occasions. They are more personal, for example, present for birthday or the day of joining the casino.</span></p>
											<h3 id="question_2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Wagering requirements for Bonuses</span></h3>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Even though these offers can be free, and customers are not forced to make any other payments, there is no chance that a casino will let them have it for nothing. Online establishments need to have some guarantee that customers are going to spend more time in their place and they are not giving bonuses for nothing. They also need something in return, so casinos have funds to provide all the further bonuses and promotions.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Wagering requirements are mandatory, so there is no way to avoid them. Though they are not high or hard to achieve, you still need to know about them.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">For any no deposit bonus, you have to pay in general 30x for the size of bonus. Free ones are the most expensive as the size of payment increases to 60x. Cashback offers have the least valuable requirements, which are only 10x.</span></p>
											<h2 id="question_3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Fair Go Casino Deposit Methods</span></h2>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">When you have your account and you are ready to go playing any games, there is this problem. You may not know how to deposit or any rules for it, so it is crucial to read all the information.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">There are only the best methods for this operation. For example, Fair go casino offer Visa, Neteller, Skrill, Bitcoin, MasterCard, POLi, and American Express. You cannot put money in the casino with Bank Transfer, but you can even not notice it as there are loads of other great options.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">The process of depositing is not difficult:</span></p>
											<ol>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Choose the game you like and read its conditions.</span></li>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Check if you can claim any Fair Go bonus. If it is so, try them and make a deposit next time.</span></li>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">If it is not so, you need to check the amount of minimum deposit and click on the button.</span></li>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">You will be asked to select the method and the amount of money you want to put in. Pay a lot of attention to this step and the limits set by the bank you prefer.</span></li>
											  <li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Confirm your intentions in the back and wait until this money is on your account.</span></li>
											  <li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Start playing hundreds exciting slots and other casino games!</span></li>
											</ol>
											<h3 id="question_2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Minimum and Maximum Deposit</span></h3>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Before you start making deposits and playing, you need to pay attention to one more thing. The minimum and maximum deposit, available by the casino and bank is important while paying money. These limits can differ from each other, so you cannot deposit less than it is allowed with back or casino.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">The lowest deposit is available with Neosurf, where you can spend only $10. However, the maximum deposit is one of the lowest as well, only $250. On average, deposit is starting from $20, but the highest can rather differ. For example, Bitcoin and Neteller let $2.5000 while Visa and MasterCard only $500.</span></p>
											<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Fair Go Casino Withdrawals Methods</span></h2>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">If there is a way to avoid making a deposit, withdrawals cannot be avoided. However, there is hardly any player who is willing not to get extra money. Of course, if you have not made any deposit, you will not get any withdrawal, as it is the rules, so do not be surprised when you are not given any money.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">There are noticeably fewer methods for withdrawal, if we compare them to the deposits. However, it does not mean that they are worse or less reliable. You can use Bitcoin, Neteller and Skrill for this operation. Moreover, Bank Transfer is available for it as well, unlike deposits. Visa, MasterCard, Neosurf and POLi are not allowed for it.</span></p>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">You do not have to be an advanced player to withdraw your money:</span></p>
											<ol>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Select the withdrawal method you want to use and check if it is available.</span></li>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Determine the sums you want to withdraw according to the limits.</span></li>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Fill in all the requested information, such as password, and card number.</span></li>
												<li><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Confirm the payment and wait some time until your winnings are on your bankcard.</span></li>
											</ol>
											<h3 id="question_2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Minimum and Maximum Withdrawal</span></h3>
											<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #7ec1a5;">Though there are not so many options for this operation, it does not mean that even the limits are bad. You need to check on them for every method individually, as it can differ from bank to bank. For example, for Skrill the minimum is $1 000 per one time, $5 000 per one day, $20 000 per one month. The maximum is high as well, from $5 000 per one time and to $50 000 per month. Other options can be lower in min and higher in the max.</span></p>
